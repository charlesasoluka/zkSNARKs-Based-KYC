# Formal Security Model for ZK KYC System

## Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive formal security analysis of the zero-knowledge KYC system, defining threat models, adversarial capabilities, security properties, and cryptographic assumptions. We present formal definitions for anonymity, unlinkability, soundness, and completeness properties, along with security proofs.

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Participants
- **Users (U)**: Individuals seeking privacy-preserving access to services
- **Issuers (I)**: Trusted entities that provide digital identity credentials (DIDs)
- **Verifiers (V)**: Smart contracts and services that verify ZK proofs
- **Registry (R)**: On-chain commitment storage and nullifier tracking system

### 1.2 Cryptographic Primitives
- **Hash Function**: Poseidon hash optimized for zk-SNARKs
- **Commitment Scheme**: Pedersen-like commitments over elliptic curves
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Groth16 zk-SNARKs
- **Digital Signatures**: ECDSA for issuer authentication
- **Merkle Trees**: Binary trees for efficient batch verification

## 2. Threat Model

#### 2.1.2 Malicious Issuers (MI)
**Assumptions:** Semi-honest but curious
**Capabilities:**
- Issue legitimate DIDs to colluding users

- Issue credentials to unauthorized entities

#### 2.1.3 Malicious Verifiers (MV)
**Capabilities:**
- Control verification logic and access decisions

- Extract private information from proofs

#### 2.1.4 Passive Network Observers (PNO)
**Capabilities:**

- Infer system usage patterns

#### 2.1.5 Active Network Attackers (ANA)
**Capabilities:**

### 2.2 Collusion Models

#### 2.2.1 Issuer Collusion
- **k-Issuer Collusion**: Up to k issuers may collude to de-anonymize users
- **Threshold**: System remains secure if < n/2 issuers are malicious
- **Recovery**: System can blacklist compromised issuers

#### 2.2.2 User-Issuer Collusion
- Issuers may issue credentials to accomplices
- System must prevent unauthorized credential usage
- Nullifier scheme prevents proof reuse even with valid credentials

## 3. Security Properties

### 3.1 Anonymity

**Definition 3.1 (Computational Anonymity):**
For any probabilistic polynomial-time adversary A, the advantage in distinguishing between two users' proof submissions is negligible:

```
Adv_A^anonymity = |Pr[A(proof_0) = 1] - Pr[A(proof_1) = 1]| ≤ negl(λ)
```

Where `proof_i` is generated by user `i` for the same access request.

**Anonymity Levels:**
1. **Sender Anonymity**: Proof submitter cannot be identified
2. **Recipient Anonymity**: Service access cannot be linked to identity  
3. **Relationship Anonymity**: Cannot determine if two proofs are from same user

### 3.2 Unlinkability

**Definition 3.2 (Unlinkability):**
Two proof submissions are unlinkable if an adversary cannot determine whether they originate from the same user with probability significantly better than random guessing:

```
Pr[A(proof_1, proof_2, aux) correctly links proofs] ≤ 1/2 + negl(λ)
```

### 3.3 Soundness

**Definition 3.3 (Soundness):**
The system is sound if no polynomial-time adversary can generate a valid proof without possessing a legitimate credential:

```
Pr[Verify(proof, public_inputs) = 1 ∧ ¬ValidCredential(adversary)] ≤ negl(λ)
```

### 3.4 Completeness

**Definition 3.4 (Completeness):**
The system is complete if any user with a valid credential can generate an accepted proof with overwhelming probability:

```
Pr[Verify(ProofGen(valid_credential), public_inputs) = 1] ≥ 1 - negl(λ)
```

### 3.5 Zero-Knowledge

**Definition 3.5 (Zero-Knowledge):**
There exists a polynomial-time simulator S such that for any verifier V*, the following distributions are computationally indistinguishable:

```
{View_V*(Prover(credential), V*)} ≈_c {S(public_inputs)}
```

## 4. Security Assumptions

### 4.1 Cryptographic Assumptions
- **Discrete Logarithm Assumption**: Computing discrete logs in elliptic curve groups is hard
- **q-Strong Bilinear Diffie-Hellman**: Required for Groth16 security
- **Collision Resistance**: Poseidon hash is collision-resistant
- **Random Oracle Model**: Hash functions behave as random oracles

### 4.2 Trust Assumptions
- **Trusted Setup**: Groth16 requires a trusted ceremony (can be verified)
- **Honest Majority**: At most n/2 - 1 issuers are malicious
- **Smart Contract Security**: Blockchain provides correct execution
- **Secure Communication**: Users can securely communicate with issuers

## 5. Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### 5.1 Commitment Attacks

#### 5.1.1 Commitment Collision Attack
**Attack**: Adversary finds two different credential sets that produce same commitment
**Mitigation**: Use cryptographically strong commitment scheme with sufficient entropy

#### 5.1.2 Commitment Grinding Attack  
**Attack**: Adversary generates many commitments to find favorable Merkle tree positions
**Mitigation**: Enforce commitment structure and rate limiting

### 5.2 Proof System Attacks

#### 5.2.1 Proof Malleability Attack
**Attack**: Transform valid proof into another valid proof for different inputs
**Mitigation**: Groth16 provides non-malleability guarantees

#### 5.2.2 Proof Grinding Attack
**Attack**: Generate many proofs to find one that reveals information
**Mitigation**: Circuit design ensures proof generation is deterministic given randomness

### 5.3 Anonymity Attacks

#### 5.3.1 Timing Analysis Attack
**Attack**: Correlate proof submission times with known user activities
**Mitigation**: Encourage batched submissions, add random delays

#### 5.3.2 Gas Usage Fingerprinting
**Attack**: Identify users by their transaction gas usage patterns
**Mitigation**: Standardize gas usage, use relayers for submission

### 5.4 Economic Attacks

#### 5.4.1 Front-Running Attack
**Attack**: Miners/searchers extract value by observing and front-running transactions
**Mitigation**: Commit-reveal schemes, private mempools

#### 5.4.2 Denial-of-Service via Gas Price Manipulation
**Attack**: Make legitimate proofs too expensive to submit
**Mitigation**: Gas price oracles, subsidized verification
