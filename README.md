# Secure ZK KYC System - Enterprise-Grade Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification

A complete, **production-ready** zero-knowledge proof system for privacy-preserving identity verification using **enhanced Tornado Cash architecture**. This secure implementation includes formal threat modeling, comprehensive security constraints, and cryptographic binding to prevent common attacks. Users can prove their eligibility for services without revealing their identity, using enhanced cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proofs.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built on proven **Tornado Cash** principles with:
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for privacy-preserving verification
- **Nullifier schemes** for preventing double-spending and replay attacks
- **Merkle trees** for efficient commitment storage and batch verification
- **Circom circuits** for generating cryptographic proofs
- **Smart contracts** for on-chain proof verification

## 🛡️ Enhanced Security Features

This secure implementation addresses critical vulnerabilities found in basic ZK identity systems:

- **Issuer Signature Verification** - Cryptographic binding prevents unauthorized credential issuance
- **Anti-Spam Economic Security** - Proof verification fees prevent DoS attacks  
- **Rate Limiting** - Per-issuer daily limits prevent bulk credential farming
- **Temporal Constraints** - Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks
- **Range Constraints** - Entropy requirements prevent brute force attacks
- **Commitment Binding** - Links commitments to specific issuers preventing cross-issuer attacks
- **Formal Threat Model** - Mathematical security proofs against defined adversaries
- **Non-Malleability** - Additional constraints prevent proof manipulation

See `SECURITY_MODEL.md` and `FORMAL_SECURITY_PROOFS.md` for detailed analysis.

## 🔄 Core Flow

1. **Trusted Issuers** register as authorized credential providers
2. **Users** generate secrets (nullifier + secret) and receive DIDs from issuers
3. **Commitments** are generated and stored in a Merkle tree registry
4. **Users** generate ZK proofs to access protected resources without revealing identity
5. **Smart contracts** verify proofs on-chain and grant/deny access

## 📦 Essential Components

### Smart Contracts
- `SecureKYCRegistry.sol` - Enhanced Merkle tree registry with issuer signature verification
- `SecureZKAccessController.sol` - Access control with anti-spam fees and rate limiting
- `MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol` - Merkle tree implementation with history
- `VerifierSecure.sol` - Enhanced Groth16 verifier with additional security constraints
- `SimpleHasher.sol` - Poseidon hash implementation for Merkle operations

### ZK Circuits
- `zkkyc_secure.circom` - Enhanced ZK circuit with issuer binding and security constraints
- `circomlib/` - Complete circuit library with cryptographic primitives
- Pre-generated circuit artifacts (`.wasm`, `.zkey`, `.r1cs`) for production use

### Core System
- `zkkyc_system.js` - Complete end-to-end ZK KYC demonstration system
- `gas_analysis.js` - Gas usage analysis for smart contract operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts and circuits
npm run compile

# Run the complete ZK KYC demonstration
npm run demo

# Alternative commands
npm test                    # Run contract tests (if available)
npm run gas-analysis        # Analyze gas usage
npm run clean              # Clean build artifacts
```

## 🔍 Complete Demo

The main demonstration script shows the entire ZK KYC flow:

4. **Create zero-knowledge proofs** for each user without revealing identity
5. **Verify proofs on-chain** and demonstrate access control
6. **Test security features** including replay attack prevention
7. **Show complete privacy preservation** throughout the process

## 🧪 Testing & Analysis

```bash
# Run all tests (if test files exist)
npm test

# Analyze gas consumption of smart contracts
npm run gas-analysis

# Clean all build artifacts
npm run clean
```
