# Formal Security Proofs for Enhanced ZK KYC System

## Abstract

This document provides rigorous mathematical proofs for the security properties of the enhanced ZK KYC system. We prove anonymity, unlinkability, soundness, completeness, and zero-knowledge properties under standard cryptographic assumptions.

## 1. System Formalization

### 1.1 Cryptographic Primitives

**Definition 1.1 (Commitment Scheme):**
A commitment scheme `Com = (Setup, Commit, Verify)` where:
- `Setup(1^λ) → pp`: Generates public parameters
- `Commit(pp, m; r) → c`: Commits to message `m` using randomness `r`
- `Verify(pp, c, m, r) → {0,1}`: Verifies commitment opens to message `m`

**Definition 1.2 (Zero-Knowledge Proof System):**
A zk-SNARK `ZK = (Setup, Prove, Verify)` where:
- `Setup(C, 1^λ) → (pk, vk)`: Circuit-specific trusted setup
- `Prove(pk, x, w) → π`: Proves knowledge of witness `w` for public input `x`
- `Verify(vk, x, π) → {0,1}`: Verifies proof `π` for public input `x`

**Definition 1.3 (Digital Signature Scheme):**
A signature scheme `Sig = (KeyGen, Sign, Verify)` where:
- `KeyGen(1^λ) → (sk, pk)`: Generates key pair
- `Sign(sk, m) → σ`: Signs message `m`
- `Verify(pk, m, σ) → {0,1}`: Verifies signature `σ` on message `m`

### 1.2 Protocol Definition

**Enhanced ZK KYC Protocol Π:**

1. **Setup Phase:**
   - `pp_com ← Com.Setup(1^λ)`
   - `(pk_zk, vk_zk) ← ZK.Setup(C_kyc, 1^λ)` where `C_kyc` is our secure circuit
   - Each issuer `I_i` generates `(sk_i, pk_i) ← Sig.KeyGen(1^λ)`

2. **Registration Phase:**
   - User generates `(nullifier, secret) ← {0,1}^λ × {0,1}^λ`
   - User requests DID from issuer: `did ← I.IssueDID(user_info)`
   - Issuer signs: `σ_did ← Sig.Sign(sk_i, did || timestamp || user)`
   - User computes: `c ← Com.Commit(pp, nullifier || secret || did || pk_i; r)`
   - User deposits commitment: `Registry.deposit(c, σ_did)`

3. **Access Phase:**
   - User generates proof: `π ← ZK.Prove(pk_zk, (merkleRoot, nullifierHash, pk_i, timestamp), (nullifier, secret, did, σ_did, merkle_path))`
   - Verifier checks: `ZK.Verify(vk_zk, (merkleRoot, nullifierHash, pk_i, timestamp), π)`
   - If valid, grant access and mark nullifier as spent

## 2. Security Proofs

### 2.1 Anonymity

**Theorem 2.1 (Computational Anonymity):**
The enhanced ZK KYC protocol Π provides computational anonymity under the q-SBDH assumption and the hiding property of the commitment scheme.

**Proof:**

Let A be a PPT adversary trying to break anonymity. We construct a sequence of games:

**Game 0:** Real anonymity experiment where A tries to distinguish between two users' proofs.

**Game 1:** Replace the commitment scheme with a perfectly hiding commitment.

**Game 2:** Replace the zk-SNARK with a perfect zero-knowledge simulator.

**Game 3:** Use independent random values for all cryptographic operations.

**Claim 2.1.1:** `|Pr[Game0] - Pr[Game1]| ≤ negl(λ)`

*Proof:* By the computational hiding property of the commitment scheme. If A can distinguish, we build an adversary B that breaks commitment hiding:
- B receives commitment challenge `c*`
- B embeds `c*` into the user's commitment  
- If A wins, B outputs A's guess
- A's advantage translates to B's advantage against commitment hiding

**Claim 2.1.2:** `|Pr[Game1] - Pr[Game2]| ≤ negl(λ)`

*Proof:* By the zero-knowledge property of Groth16 zk-SNARKs. If A can distinguish, we build a simulator S:
- S uses the ZK simulator instead of real proofs
- S's output is indistinguishable from real proofs
- A's advantage violates ZK property

**Claim 2.1.3:** `|Pr[Game2] - Pr[Game3]| = 0`

*Proof:* In Game 2, all values are already independent random values due to perfect hiding and zero-knowledge.

**Claim 2.1.4:** `Pr[Game3] = 1/2`

*Proof:* In Game 3, A sees only random values independent of the challenge bit.

Therefore: `Adv_A^anonymity = |Pr[Game0] - 1/2| ≤ negl(λ)` □

### 2.2 Unlinkability  

**Theorem 2.2 (Unlinkability):**
Two proof submissions in protocol Π are computationally unlinkable under the DDH assumption.

**Proof:**

Let A be a PPT adversary trying to link two proofs. We show that A's advantage is negligible.

**Key Insight:** Each proof uses a fresh nullifier hash computed as:
`nullifierHash = H(nullifier, recipient, timestamp)`

Since `(recipient, timestamp)` vary between proofs and `nullifier` is random, each `nullifierHash` is fresh.

**Formal Proof:**

1. **Commitment Unlinkability:** 
   - Commitments `c_1, c_2` for same user use same `(nullifier, secret, did)` but different randomness `r_1, r_2`
   - By commitment hiding: `c_1, c_2` are indistinguishable from random

2. **Proof Unlinkability:**
   - Proofs `π_1, π_2` are zero-knowledge
   - Public inputs `(merkleRoot, nullifierHash_1, pk_i, timestamp_1)` and `(merkleRoot, nullifierHash_2, pk_i, timestamp_2)` differ in `nullifierHash` and `timestamp`
   - By collision resistance of H: `nullifierHash_1 ≠ nullifierHash_2` with overwhelming probability

3. **Global Unlinkability:**
   - Combine commitment and proof unlinkability
   - No adversary can link proofs with advantage better than random guessing

Therefore: `Pr[A \text{ links correctly}] ≤ 1/2 + negl(λ)` □

### 2.3 Soundness

**Theorem 2.3 (Computational Soundness):**
Protocol Π is computationally sound under the q-SBDH assumption and the EUF-CMA security of the signature scheme.

**Proof:**

Let A be a PPT adversary trying to produce a valid proof without a legitimate credential. A must succeed in one of these strategies:

**Strategy 1:** Forge issuer signature on DID
- Probability of success: `≤ Adv_A^EUF-CMA(λ) ≤ negl(λ)`

**Strategy 2:** Break zk-SNARK soundness
- Probability of success: `≤ Adv_A^q-SBDH(λ) ≤ negl(λ)`

**Strategy 3:** Find commitment collision
- Two different credential sets map to same commitment
- Probability of success: `≤ Adv_A^binding(λ) ≤ negl(λ)`

**Strategy 4:** Break Merkle tree binding
- Include invalid commitment in tree
- Prevented by collision resistance of hash function
- Probability of success: `≤ Adv_A^collision(λ) ≤ negl(λ)`

**Union Bound:**
`Pr[A \text{ breaks soundness}] ≤ Adv_A^EUF-CMA + Adv_A^q-SBDH + Adv_A^binding + Adv_A^collision ≤ negl(λ)` □

### 2.4 Completeness

**Theorem 2.4 (Completeness):**
Protocol Π is complete with probability `≥ 1 - negl(λ)`.

**Proof:**

For a user with valid credential `(nullifier, secret, did, σ_did)`:

1. **Commitment Generation:** 
   - `c = Com.Commit(nullifier || secret || did || pk_i; r)` succeeds with probability 1

2. **Merkle Tree Inclusion:**
   - Valid commitment is included in tree with probability 1
   - Merkle path computation is deterministic

3. **Proof Generation:**
   - All circuit constraints satisfied by honest user
   - Groth16 prover succeeds with probability `≥ 1 - negl(λ)`

4. **Verification:**
   - All public inputs computed correctly
   - Verifier accepts valid proof with probability `≥ 1 - negl(λ)`

**Failure Probability Analysis:**
- Commitment failure: 0
- Merkle tree failure: 0  
- Proof generation failure: `≤ negl(λ)`
- Verification failure: `≤ negl(λ)`

Therefore: `Pr[\text{Valid user accepted}] ≥ 1 - negl(λ)` □

### 2.5 Zero-Knowledge

**Theorem 2.5 (Zero-Knowledge):**
Protocol Π is computational zero-knowledge under the q-SBDH assumption.

**Proof:**

We construct a PPT simulator S that can simulate proof transcripts without knowing the witness.

**Simulator Construction:**
```
Simulator S(vk, (merkleRoot, nullifierHash, pk_i, timestamp)):
1. Run zk-SNARK simulator: π ← ZK.Sim(vk, (merkleRoot, nullifierHash, pk_i, timestamp))
2. Output π
```

**Indistinguishability Proof:**

For any PPT verifier V*, we show:
`{View_V*(Prover(w), V*)} ≈_c {S(public_inputs)}`

**Hybrid Argument:**
- **Hybrid 0:** Real prover interaction
- **Hybrid 1:** Simulated zk-SNARK (by Groth16 ZK property)
- Hybrids are indistinguishable by q-SBDH assumption

**Key Properties Preserved:**
1. Public inputs remain unchanged
2. Proof verification still succeeds  
3. No private information leaked

Therefore: `Adv_V*^ZK ≤ negl(λ)` □

## 3. Composite Security Analysis

### 3.1 Security Under Composition

**Theorem 3.1 (Concurrent Security):**
Protocol Π remains secure under concurrent execution with polynomially many users and proofs.

**Proof Sketch:**
1. **Anonymity:** Each proof uses independent randomness
2. **Unlinkability:** Nullifier uniqueness ensures no collisions
3. **Soundness:** Security reduces to underlying primitives
4. **Completeness:** No interference between honest users

### 3.2 Adaptive Security

**Theorem 3.2 (Adaptive Security):**
Protocol Π provides security against adaptive adversaries who can choose inputs after seeing previous proofs.

**Proof Sketch:**
1. All security reductions work in adaptive setting
2. Simulator can handle adaptive queries
3. Commitment scheme provides adaptive security

## 4. Practical Security Parameters

- Zero-knowledge error: `≤ 2^{-128}`

**Signature Security:**
